Exploratory Data Analysis on global well-being using health, education, and economic indicators.

# 🩺 The Data of Well-being

*Exploring how health, education, and economy shape global well-being in 2023.*

---

## 🌍 Overview

This project is part of the **Data of Happiness Portfolio**, a series of data science explorations that investigate what defines human well-being beyond wealth.

In this first step, we focus on understanding how **economic**, **educational**, and **health** indicators interact across countries — uncovering global patterns of inequality, sustainability, and development.

Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, we aim to answer a simple but essential question:

> 💭 *Are richer countries truly better off — or does well-being depend on a deeper balance between health, knowledge, and opportunity?*

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore global trends in health, education, and economy

2. Are higher GDP countries always healthier or better educated?  
3. Which regions achieve “balanced” well-being?  
4. How are environmental factors linked to health and education outcomes?
