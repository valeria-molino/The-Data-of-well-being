## 🌍 Overview

This project is part of the **Data of Happiness Portfolio**, a series of data science explorations that investigate what defines human well-being beyond wealth.

In this first step, we focus on understanding how **economic**, **educational**, and **health** indicators interact across countries — uncovering global patterns of inequality, sustainability, and development.

Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, we aim to answer a simple but essential question:

> 💭 *Are richer countries truly better off — or does well-being depend on a deeper balance between health, knowledge, and opportunity?*

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore global trends in health, education, and economy  
- Identify correlations and interactions among well-being indicators  
- Detect regional patterns of inequality or development  
- Create a foundation for future predictive models of well-being  

---

## 🧠 Research Questions

1. How do education, economy, and health correlate globally?  
2. Are higher GDP countries always healthier or better educated?  
3. Which regions achieve “balanced” well-being?  
4. How are environmental factors linked to health and education outcomes?

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** [Countries of the World 2023 – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/countries-of-the-world-2023)

The dataset includes over 200 countries and indicators on:
- Population, density, land area  
- GDP and taxes  
- Education enrollment rates  
- Life expectancy and infant mortality  
- CO₂ emissions, agricultural land, and forest coverage

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- `Python`  
- `pandas`, `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` 
- `scikit-learn`

## 📈 Results Summary

The exploratory analysis revealed several global trends:

- **Economic strength and well-being are correlated**, but not perfectly — countries with moderate GDP sometimes achieve high life expectancy and education levels.

- **Education and health indicators** show strong positive relationships (countries with higher tertiary enrollment also have longer life expectancy).

- **CO₂ emissions** tend to increase with GDP, highlighting the trade-off between development and sustainability.

- **Urbanization** generally correlates with improved access to healthcare and education, but also higher emissions.

Visualizations such as bubble plots and pairwise correlations emphasized how health and education balance economic growth across different regions.
